This is a simple text filter made for a systems software course. To use simply compile with GCC (gcc -o filter prog1.c) and then you can run filter. When run with no parameters the filter simply returns what was typed. If the parameter '-u' is specified then evverything typed will be returned in uppercase. If the parameter '-l' is specified then everything typed will be returned in lowercase.
